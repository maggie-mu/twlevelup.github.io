        from 6pm till 9pm, for 7 weeks (with a week off for Easter). There's a special day set aside on Saturday the 9th of May for your team's final showcase and the graduation ceremony.

      <div class='question'>
        What are the different roles?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Everyone is going to be involved in design, taking ownership and the overall quality of the project. You will have to collaborate on
        <strong>all</strong>
        aspects of the project to ensure kick-ass software!
        <ul id='selector'>
          <li>Analysts work closely with product owners to capture requirements and figure out the details.</li>

      <div class='answer'>To make this the best experience we can, we need cross functional teams with the right combination of people in each role (developer, business analyst and tester). Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, places are limited.</div>
