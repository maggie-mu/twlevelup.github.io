      .question
        What am I going to learn?
      .answer
        LevelUp EXP (EXP stands for 'Express') is a one-day conference style event designed to help you bridge the gap between university and your first full time job. You will learn about
        %a{:href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"} Agile software development
        and hopefully we ignite a spark of curiosity in you around some useful concepts like continuous delivery, test automation, pair programming, test-driven development, retrospectives and more!

      .question
        How?

      .answer
        Having lots of fun! Real world consultants become your coaches in this one-day conference, teaching concepts we think you should know through hands-on activities, interactive sessions, discussions and games.

      .question
        When is it?
      .answer
        It is a day event that will start from 10:00am to 6:00pm - and we stay around for a chat but that is completely up to you.

      .question
        What do I need to bring?
      .answer
        Nothing! Food and drinks will be provided.

      .question
        Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?
      .answer
        While the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, to keep this awesome experience free for you, places are limited as our physical location is our constraining factor!
        %p
          After you register, keep an eye out from us that will let you know if your spot is confirmed.
