        Over 8 weeks, you'll deliver a project from start to finish, guided by
        a team of ThoughtWorks consultants. We'll teach you everything you need
        to know along the way, from Agile planning and design to writing and
        testing your own code. You won't just walk away with working software
        for your portfolio - you'll have knowledge, skills and experience to
        hit the ground running in the workplace.

    <h2>Course Information</h2>

    <div class='questions'>
      <div class='question'>
        What am I going to learn?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        This course is designed to bridge the gap between university and your first full time job.
        You'll experience real world
        <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development'>Agile software development</a>
        first-hand. You'll learn all about inceptions, standups, story writing, continuous delivery, test automation, pairing, test-driven development, retrospectives and more.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        How?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        When you start the course you will meet your team, product owners and
        come up with a concept working with open data. From then on you will
        work with your team to deliver a product that uses that data to do
        something interesting. The LevelUp team will offer guidance and
        hands-on support to help you get your software across the line.  Make
        no mistake though, it's you who will be getting the job done!
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        When is it?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The kickoff day is on the 29nd March and filled with games, workshops
        and group work. Then, we meet weekly from the 24th of March, every
        <strong>Saturday starting at 11am.</strong>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What are the different roles?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Everyone is going to be involved in design, taking ownership, overall
        quality. You will have to collaborate on
        <strong>all</strong>
        aspects of the project to ensure a kick-ass product!
        <ul id='selector'>
          <li>
            Business analysts - work closely with product owners to capture
            requirements and figure out the details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developers - will build the software.
          </li>
          <li>
            Testers - help ensure the overall quality of the product, and
            provide feedback to developers and business analysts.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What happens when I pick a role - am I stuck with it?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        In order to ensure balanced teams, we need people to stick with their
        role. However, because this is an agile team, just because you're a
        developer doesn't mean you'll be writing code all the time.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What do I need to bring?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Nothing! Food and drinks will be provided. You may bring your own
        laptop if you want, but machines will be provided for you to work on.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        To make this the best experience we can we need cross functional teams
        with the right combination of people in each role (developer, business
        analyst and tester). Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept
        everyone, places are limited.
