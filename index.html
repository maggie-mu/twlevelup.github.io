      "Love how the program is relaxed and not too corporate or formal. The
      practical activities were really good for explaining concepts."

      "I came into LevelUp having done a lot of programming but no experience
      with delivering software. I'd heard of Agile, but had no idea what it
      involved. After completing the first LevelUp, an interviewer told me I'd
      given a better run-down of Agile methodologies than developers who'd
      spent ten years doing it."
