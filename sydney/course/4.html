      <div class='question'>
        What am I going to learn?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        This course is designed to bridge the gap between university and your first full time job.
        You'll experience real world
        <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development'>Agile software development</a>
        first-hand. Learn all about inceptions, standups, story writing, continuous delivery, pairing, test-driven development, retrospectives and more.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        How?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        When you start the course you will meet your team, product owners and come up with a concept for a video game. From then on you will work with your team to deliver a game. The LevelUp team will offer guidance and hands-on support to help you get your software across the line. Make no mistake though, it's you who will be getting the job done!
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        When is it?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The kickoff day is on the 13th September and filled with games, workshops and group work. Then, we meet weekly from the 16th of September, every
        <strong>Tuesday night</strong>
        from 6pm till 9pm.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What are the different roles?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Everyone is going to be involved in design, taking ownership, overall quality. You will have to collaborate on
        <strong>all</strong>
        aspects of the project to ensure a kick-ass game!
        <ul id='selector'>
          <li>Business analysts work closely with product owners to capture requirements and figure out the details.</li>
          <li>Developers will build the game and ensure the overall quality of the product.</li>
          <li>Designer will produce assets and visual direction of the product</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What happens when I pick a role&mdash;am I stuck with it?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        In order to ensure balanced teams, we need people to stick with their role. However, because this is an agile team, just because you're a developer doesn't mean you'll be writing code all the time.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What do I need to bring?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Developers
        <strong>must</strong>
        bring their own laptop. Food and drinks will be provided. If you're not a developer, a laptop is useful but not essential.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        But I don't know anything about video games.
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        I'm sure you have some awesome ideas though.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?</div>
      <div class='answer'>To make this the best experience we can, we need cross functional teams with the right combination of people in each role (developer, business analyst and designer). Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, places are limited.</div>
