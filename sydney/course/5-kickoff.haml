      Over 8 weeks you'll deliver a project from start to finish, guided by a team of ThoughtWorks consultants. We'll teach you everything you need to know along the way, from Agile planning and design to writing and testing your own code. You won't just walk away with working software for your portfolio&mdash;you'll have knowledge, skills and experience to hit the ground running in the workplace.
